# Advent of Code 2019

My solutions (or lack thereof) for the Advent of Code 2019.

This year, I'm not going to attempt using different languages for the sake of learning or experimentation. This year I think I'll just try to complete the puzzles if I have time.

This also means my other side projects will suffer, but they suffer anyway. :)

## Languages

I'll try to list the languages used here, probably a mixture of JavaScript, C and Python, but maybe others. Maybe Go.

* Day 1: JavaScript / Go
* Day 2: JavaScript
* Day 3: Go
* Day 4: Go
* Day 5: Go (Including re-implementing Day 2's solution in Go)
